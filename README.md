# Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage
__HOSTED BY DRIVEN DATA__
by Harriet Sands

## Overview

Based on aspects of building location and construction, the goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.

This is an intermediate-level practice competition hosted by [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/).

The data was collected through surveys by the Central Bureau of Statistics that work under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

## Running the code 

Currently I am running my code through `notebooks/explore.ipynb` but I intend to build a main.py script
